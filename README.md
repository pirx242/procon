#### PROCON - A PROCESS AND NETWORK CONNECTION SURVEILLANCE/INSPECTION TOOL

_procon_ is a simple Python script that is intended to be run on a remote
(or local) server to check which processes run there, and report of any 
suspicious activity (unknown processes, unexpected open files or network
connections, etc).

The config file(s) that can be specified contain specifications for allowed
processes. Sample config files are included.

A simple bash script for running procon remotely is included.

This project is still very much under construction.
Feature requests are *encouraged*.
